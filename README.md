# PcbLayout

Bachelor diploma project.
I have PCB. Arrange elements on it. Write heating parameters (coefficients, time, etc.).
Push Start to begin calculating a heating field.
Algorithm I received from my teacher doesn't work.

There is a database to save information about PCB, elements and heating parameters.
I used labels to draw PCB and elements.

About main mistakes.

1) Naming is much better here. But methods should be renamed.

2) A little code repetition.
